# ALTERNATIVE: Hardcode directly in the scripts
# =============================================================================
# If you prefer to hardcode the keys directly in the Python scripts instead of
# using environment files, you can uncomment and edit the hardcoded sections in:
# - scripts/scraper.py (lines 32-34)
# - scripts/process_and_upload.py (lines 37-39)
#
# This is useful if you're working locally and don't want to manage .env files,
# but remember to NEVER commit hardcoded credentials to version control!
